                    <p class="short-text" style="color: blue;">Nearly a decade since he last voiced the character, James
                        Spader will return as Ultron in the Disney+ Vision series.</p>
                    <p class="long-text" style="color: blue;">Ultron is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as
                        James Spader is set to appear as the villain in the upcoming untitled Vision series on Disney+.
                        Spader previously played Ultron in 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, which was also the debut film
                        of Paul Bettany's Vision character. That film seemingly ended with Vision killing Ultron,
                        although the fact that the film cut away from Vision's killing blast has made fans doubt the
                        character's demise and hope for his eventual return.

                        Nearly a decade later, Spader is confirmed to return as Ultron. According to The Hollywood
                        Reporter, Spader is joining the cast of the untitled Vision series, previously known as Vision
                        Quest. Star Trek: Picard showrunner Terry Matalas is leading the Vision series, which will
                        follow the White Vision constructed in WandaVision as he searches for his purpose in life. The
                        series is the third chapter in a trilogy of stories that started with WandaVision and will
                        continue with Agatha All Along. Notably, the report says Spader will voice Ultron, not provide
                        motion capture as he did in Avengers: Age of Ultron.Ultron was created by writer Roy Thomas and
                        artist John Buscema and debuted in The Avengers #54 back in July 1968. In the comics, Ultron was
                        invented by Ant-Man hero Hank Pym, but the MCU version was reimagined as a creation of Tony
                        Stark. In Age of Ultron, Tony created the Vision body for himself to evolve before the Avengers
                        stole it and uploaded JARVIS, creating the new hero Vision. While Ultron was defeated, his
                        impact on the MCU was felt for years as the destruction of Sokovia led to the creation of the
                        Sokovia Accords, which fractured the Avengers in Captain America: Civil War, and left them
                        divided in their fight against Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. Vision's ties to both the
                        origin story of Vision and the Scarlet Witch have loomed large over the MCU.</p>

                    <p class="short-text" style="color: blue;">The Watchmen director shares his thoughts on Marvel
                        Studios' controversial future plans.</p>
                    <p class="long-text" style="color: blue;">While the Marvel fan base is divided about the Russo
                        Brothers returning to the MCU to direct Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, bona-fide
                        superhero director Zack Snyder is feeling optimistic about the beloved directors making their
                        Marvel comeback. Joe and Anthony Russo are responsible for some of Marvel Studios' most beloved
                        and successful movies, including Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Infinity War
                        and, the second-biggest movie of all-time, Avengers: Endgame. When Kevin Feige announced that
                        the Russos were returning to direct the next two Avengers movies, fans had mixed opinions. Some
                        thought it was a lazy, overly-safe decision on Marvel Studios' part. However, others, like Zack
                        Snyder, are glad that Marvel have paired with two directors who have established themselves as
                        great comic book movie filmmakers.

                        Zack Snyder appeared on the ReelBlend podcast to discuss his Director's Cuts for the Rebel Moon
                        franchise. During the conversation, Snyder was asked for his opinion about the Russos making
                        their Marvel comeback. Snyder is optimistic about Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars, believing
                        the Russos to be the perfect pair to get the franchise out of its slump.
                        He said:

                        "I think that's great for them. They're amazing, and they've done really, I think they've done
                        great work with those guys. I'm sure they'll do something amazing. They're talented guys, and I
                        think they'll do something cool. I think it's time to shake it up a little bit."
                        Marvel Studios' cinematic slump could be coming to an end. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3
                        was a massive hit, the franchise, which once dominated at the box office, has been on the
                        receiving end of poor reviews and low box office figures for its Phase 5 slate of movies.
                        Deadpool & Wolverine has helped put Marvel Studios back on their feet — becoming the highest
                        grossing R-rated movie in the process — but the studio needs more than one hit to carry them
                        over the finish line for their Multiverse Saga.</p>
