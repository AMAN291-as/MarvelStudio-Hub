                        Marvel Zombies’ Low Episode Count Confirmed, with Major Role for Phase 4 Hero</h3>
                    <p class="short-text" style="color: blue;">Marvel Zombies will be rated TV-MA and consist of four
                        episodes with a major role for Shang-Chi and the mysterious Ten Rings.</p>
                    <p class="long-text" style="color: blue;">Marvel Zombies just got some significant updates out of
                        D23. Originating in a comic book storyline from Ultimate Fantastic Four, Marvel Zombies became a
                        major storyline of its own for Marvel Comics, with a critically acclaimed miniseries running
                        from 2005 to 2006, subsequently spawning multiple sequels, spin-offs, and merchandising. Fans
                        got their first glimpse of Marvel Zombies in Season 1 of What If...? titled "What If...
                        Zombies?!" on September 8, 2021, before Marvel Zombies was officially confirmed as its own
                        animated series in development at Disney+ Day on November 2021.

                        During the Marvel Animations panel at D23 on Saturday, it was confirmed that Marvel Zombies will
                        be a four-episode event with a TV-MA rating (via Empire Magazine.) It has also been confirmed
                        that the series is a follow-up to the What If...? episode, with a clip showing Shang-Chi, Wenwu,
                        and Katy fighting off zombie hordes with the Ten Rings before flashing forward five years into
                        an apocalyptic future.<br>DiscussingFilm also detailed footage from the event that put a
                        spotlight on Shang-Chi, who, after he is bitten by a zombie, is saved from death when his
                        father, Wenwu, gives him the Ten Rings to hold off the zombie infection. Shang-Chi, Katy, and
                        FBI agent Jimmy Woo from Ant-Man and the Wasp and WandaVision are seen teaming up to fight a Mad
                        Max-style Skrull Biker Gang. During the D23 Marvel Animation presentation, Bryan Andrews came
                        out on stage and said, “People love their zombies, and so does Brad [Winderbaum], and so does
                        Kevin [Feige].”<br>The news that Shang-Chi will be a major player in Marvel Zombies also comes
                        after confirmation that the character will appear in What If...? Season 3. Shang-Chi and the
                        Legend of the Ten Rings hit theaters just as What If...? Season 1 was airing, with the Marvel
                        Zombies-inspired episode airing just five days after the movie opened. While no sequel to
                        Shang-Chi has been confirmed yet, the character has already been said to have a big role to play
                        in the future of the franchise, and it seems that includes its animated offerings.

                        Marvel Zombies will feature many other Phase 4 and Phase 5 characters, as many of the Infinity
                        Saga heroes were already shown to have become zombies themselves in the What If...? episode. It
                        was confirmed at a previous D23 that Ms. Marvel will also appear, with Iman Villani returning to
                        voice the character. It will also include Eternals, Kate Bishop from Hawkeye, and various
                        members of the Thunderbolts* cast of characters, including Yelena Belova, Red Guardian, and
                        Ghost.<br>While no premiere date is set for Marvel Zombies, there is a good chance they will
                        hold off on releasing it until 2025 to coincide with the Halloween season. Marvel released
                        Werewolf by Night in October 2022, and Agatha All Along will air from September 18, 2024,
                        through October to capitalize on the Halloween season. With four episodes, Marvel Zombies could
                        be Marvel's 2025 Halloween event, airing through October until the final episode just before
                        Halloween.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p class="short-text" style="color: blue;">The animated series spinoff of Black Panther will feature
                        a beloved Marvel character, but will be remarkably short.</p>
                    <p class="long-text" style="color: blue;">The upcoming animated Marvel series Eyes of Wakanda will
                        delve into the history of the mysterious nation more than ever before, following a band of
                        Wakandan warriors called The War Dogs as they travel the world in search of dangerous vibranium
                        artifacts. Spinning off from the incredibly popular MCU Black Panther movies, the animated
                        series is surprisingly short with only four episodes. Fan reactions to the series' announcement
                        have been mixed, but one new reveal from D23 has Marvel audiences particularly excited: Iron
                        Fist will be a prominent character in the series. You can check out the official synopsis for
                        the series below.

                        Throughout Wakandan history, brave warriors have been tasked to travel the world retrieving
                        dangerous vibranium artifacts. This is their story.<br>Head of TV for Marvel Studios, Brad
                        Winderbaum, has revealed the scope of the series, teasing how crucial it will be to the wider
                        MCU and how it will expand the lore of both Wakanda and Black Panther.

                        "Eyes of Wakanda, more than any other show we're doing in animation, ties in the MCU...It's both
                        about the history of Wakanda, but it also expands into the greater MCU at different time
                        periods. So of you're a fan of the movies, I think this show is going to be a real treat."</p>
